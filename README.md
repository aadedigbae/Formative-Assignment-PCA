# FORMATIVE ASSIGNMENT

This analysis delves into the application of advanced linear algebra concepts, particularly eigenvalues and eigenvectors, along with multivariate probability through covariance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by identifying the relationships between existing features. The essence of the algorithm lies in discovering the principal components, which capture the most significant variance in the data, and evaluating their relevance. By transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, PCA preserves as much information as possible. Covariance helps reveal the underlying relationships between the features.
